Hello everybody! I'm <span class="heimu" title="这是可以说的吗">我的姓名</span>, and you can also call me by my English name OrderChaos / OrdChaos. Today, I want to tell you something about chorus there. Yes, I know you may hate the chorus class in the noon, but please don't hate the chorus itself. 

Chorus refers to the art category of collective singing of multi-voice vocal works. It requires a high degree of unity of single voice and harmony of melody between voices. It is one of the most popular and widely participated forms of music performance. As the expressive tool of chorus art, the human voice has its unique advantages, which can most directly express the thoughts and emotions in the musical works and stimulate the emotional resonance of the audience.

There are many types of chorus. In terms of voice and timbre, it is divided into two types: unison and chorus. Singing in unison refers to a chorus form in which all chorus members sing the same tune together regardless of their voices. It is often used in mass singing activities and can also be used in some fragments of chorus. Chorus refers to the superposition or contrast of two or more different parts of the chorus. It is one of the most typical forms of chorus. And from the accompaniment form, it is divided into two forms: a cappella and accompaniment. “A cappella” means to sung without instrumental accompaniment. It is a purely vocal art form. For example, the song 半个月亮爬上来 we have learned is an a cappella song. In contrast, accompaniment chorus is a form of chorus with accompaniment. Whether it is harmony, mode, dynamics, speed, or style, mood, and performance, they must be unified into the overall work as required.

Most of the choral songs are sung by the choir. A choir usually has a conductor with others who sing songs. Don't think that the conductors just need to wave their hands, in fact they should do the things that much more complicated than this. For example, the free extension mark and the fade out mark in the score need to be controlled by the overall situation by the conductor, otherwise the song will become very discordant. Songs with weak or strong rhythm also need conductor to beat the rhythm, songs with different emphasis and emphasis also need to be reminded by the conductor. The coordination of multiple voices is also very important, a little attention will be taken out of tune, so everyone should use their own free time to practice - not make up the number.

Having said so much, I should also play a chorus song to listen to it, right? Let's listen to 启程 sung by the *Globe Jinshengyuzhen Choir* (金声玉振合唱团). This is a new song learned this term - why do I know? Because I am a member of it.
